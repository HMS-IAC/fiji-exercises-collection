# Fiji Exercises Collection
<strong>By the <a href="https://iac.hms.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Image Analysis Collaboratory</a> @ Harvard Medical School</strong>

<p>
    This is a collection of exercises for the open-source <a href="https://fiji.sc/" target="_blank">Fiji</a> software.
</p>

The exercises are designed to be used in a classroom setting, but can also be used for self-study. They are divided into sections, each of which covers a different topic and/or a different aspect of Fiji.

Here is an example illustrating the structure of the exercises:

<span style="font-size: 1.5em;">**1.1 - Image inspection**</span>

1. open the [single_channel.tif](images/single_channel.tif) image (drag & drop, or `File > Open`)
2. `Image > Duplicate` (IJ:28.9) (**shift + d**)
3. `Analyze > Histogram` (IJ:30.10) (**h**)
4. click `live`
5. `Image > Adjust > Brightness/Contrast` (**shift + c**)
    - play with `Maximum`, `Minimum`, `Brightness` and `Contrast` sliders and with `Auto`, `Set` and `Reset`
    - observe the histogram window, what is changing, what is not?
    - click `Apply`
    - what changed?

<br>

You can perform each exercise using the **provided image(s)** (click the image name to download it - note that downloads may not work properly in Safari) or with **your own images**.

For certain Fiji commands, references to the <a href="https://imagej.net/ij/docs/guide/" target="_blank">ImageJ User Guide</a> are included (e.g. **IJ:28.9**) as a helpful resource for learning more about Fijiâ€™s features and capabilities.

If a command has a keyboard shortcut, it is indicated in parentheses in **bold** (e.g. **shift + d**).

Have fun!
