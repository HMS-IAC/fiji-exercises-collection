# Fiji Exercises Collection

This is a collection of exercises for the open-source [Fiji](https://fiji.sc/) software.

The exercises are designed to be used in a classroom setting, but can also be used for self-study. The exercises are divided into sections, each of which covers a different aspect of Fiji.
